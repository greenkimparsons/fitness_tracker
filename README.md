This homework helped me understand more and practice with MongoDB. It was definitely more enjoyable than the other recent homeworks. I started off with creating the models and the server.js file. Then I moved onto the routes because it takes me longer to do and think about. Also deploying to Heroku and Atlas was hard and don't think I could've done it without help from a Peter.
